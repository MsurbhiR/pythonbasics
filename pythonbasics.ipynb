It is easy to understand and write.\n","  -Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. and also it has a a large and active community of developers, an extensive standard library, and third-party packages for various domains. that's why it popular.\n","\n","Que 2 : What is an interpreter in Python?\n","  - The Python interpreter is a program that executes Python code.\n","  - it executes code line-by-line rather than compiling the entire code before execution.\n","\n","Que 3 : What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n","  - pre-define keywords in python:\n","    in, not in, def, if, else, elif, for, while, ture, false, import, class, return, try etc.\n","\n","Que 4 : Can keywords be used as variable names?\n","  - No, we can not use keywords as variable name.\n","\n","Que 5 : What is mutability in Python?\n","  - Mutability affects how objects are stored and manipulated in memory, impacting performance, memory usage, and concurrency in Python programs. mutable object can be modify after creation.\n","  - list, dictionary are mutable objects.\n","\n","Que 6 :  Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","  - Data of list are store in ordered collection, they have perticluar index for every data item. we can access & modify the data of list. But in tuple, there is no way to access or modify the data, that's why tuple is immutable ans list is mutable.\n","\n","Que 7 : What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n","  - The ‘ == ’ is known as the equality operator.It checks if the values of two objects are equal. If the values are the same, it returns True, otherwise False. whereas the ‘is’ is known as the identity operator.It does not compare values, it checks whether the variables point to the same memory location.\n","\n","Que 8 : What are logical operators in Python?\n","  - logical operaters : AND, OR, NOT.\n","\n","Que 9 :  What is type casting in Python?\n","  - Type casting is a proccess of change data type to another data type.Type casting is often necessary for performing arithmetic operations, data manipulation, and input/output operations in Python programs.\n","\n","Que 10 : What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","  - In implicit type casting, the python automatically converts data from one type to another if needed. explicit type casting occurs when the programmer explicitly converts a value from one data type to another.\n","\n","Que 11 :  What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","  -  Conditional statements used to execute code based on the evaluation of one or more conditions.\n","\n","Que 12 :  How does the elif statement work?\n","  - elif statement is basically use for give choice or execute multiple condition together.in other words, The elif keyword is pythons way of saying \"if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition\".\n","\n","Que 13 : What is the difference between for and while loops?\n","  - The while loop is used when you don't know in advance how many times you want to execute the block of code. It continues to execute as long as the specified condition is true.\n","  - The for loop is used when you know in advance how many times you want to execute the block of code.\n","\n","  Que 14 :   Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n","  - One main difference is while loops are best suited when you do not know ahead of time the number of iterations that you need to do. When you know this before entering the loop you can use for loop.\n","\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n","\n","PRACTICAL QUESTION:\n","\n","Que 1 : Write a Python program to print \"Hello,
